        <p>The Summer is different in Idaho. Just a short drive from the University town
        there are great hikes and all sorts of adventures to go on. My family and I, love to
        exploring and find new and amazing places.
        </p><br>
        <p>Camping is a favorite activity to do as a family, taking the kids into the mountains 
            and letting them experiance nature and the beauty of it all. Helps us feel close to 
            our Heavenly father and the Savior.
