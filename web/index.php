        <p>Currently I am a University Student in Idaho 
    studying Software Engineering. Married with three children, my life
    is currently very busy, between family and school, I have little time
    for the hobbies I once enjoyed.</p><br>
    <p>Being from Canada, my winters were spent on the slopes of the Fernie Alpine Resort,
    in British Columbia. There is nothing like the freedom you can feel flying down a mountain, floating
    on a soft cloud of snow. There are some ski resorts by the Univeristy, but they just don't compare
    with home. Where the mountains are bigger and the snow is deeper. <br><br>
    Not all is lost though, my daughter is three now, and I think its time I strap
    some sticks to her feet and send her down the mountain.</p>
